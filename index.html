    <h1>Cheese Fan Club</h1>
    <p id="p1">Welcome the Cheese club by Jane and Amin,we here love and talk about cheese,we only think about cheese and only about cheese so please respect the cheese comminuty as we are so small but we accept new memebers,as members as just Amin and Jane cuz we are lonely as fuck</p>
    <p id="p3">The production of cheese predates recorded history, beginning well over 7,000 years ago.Humans likely developed cheese and other dairy foods by accident, as a result of storing and transporting milk in bladders made of ruminants' stomachs; Within the stomach an inherent supply of rennet would encourage curdling, forming cheese. There is no conclusive evidence indicating where cheese-making originated: possibly Europe, or Central Asia, the Middle East, or the Sahara.</p>

    <p id="p4">Cheeses can be categorized by their texture and aging process into several main types: fresh, soft-ripened, semi-soft, semi-hard, hard, and blue. Other classifications include pasta filata (stretched curd cheese like mozzarella) and processed cheese. Examples of cheeses in these categories include ricotta (fresh), Brie (soft-ripened), Gouda (semi-hard), and Parmesan (hard). </p>

    <p id="p7">Thank you for visiting the Cheese Fan Club website,we hope you enjoyed your stay and please come back again</p>
    <p id="p8">one of the most ineresting type of cheese is Casu martzu,Casu martzu[1] (Sardinian: [ˈkazu ˈmaɾtsu]; lit. 'rotten cheese') is a Sardinian sheep milk cheese that contains live fly maggots.

The larvae of the cheese fly (Piophila casei) are deliberately introduced to pecorino cheese, where their digestive action produces an advanced level of fermentation, including a breakdown of the cheese's fats. The cheese's texture softens, and a liquid called làgrima ('teardrop') may seep out.</p>
    <p id="p9">Casu martzu is considered unsafe to eat according to food hygiene regulations, and its sale is banned by the European Union. However, it remains available on the black market and is considered a delicacy by some Sardinians.</p>
